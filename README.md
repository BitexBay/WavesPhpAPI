# WavesPhpAPI

The wrapper and pre-processor for conventional node REST API and cryptographic primitives.
In spite of including only basic functional, it's easily extensible for all operations you need (such as leasing or batch transfers).

See [https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/wiki](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/wiki) to learn more about REST API

## Requirements 
  * CURL utility (console access, optional)
  * PHP 5.4+
  * Base58 encoder/decoder
  * Curve-25519 extension
  * Blake2b library or extension (optional)
  * Keccak256 library or extension (optional)

Hashing is applied only in manipulations with account (wallet) and node's API key.
All crypto-methods are combined in trait, so one may use custom implementation of any of these algorithms.

## Installation
1. Clone [curve-25519 repository](https://github.com/mgp25/curve25519-php) and compile the extension
2. Clone [blake2 repossitory](https://github.com/strawbrary/php-blake2) and compile the extension (optional)
3. Edit *composer.json* accordingly to your preferences
4. Clone the repo and use *composer* to complete the installation

## Usage

### Account

Create new account

```$account = new \Wavesapi\Account();```

or import existing one

```$account = new \Wavesapi\Account($base58EncodedSeed);```

Get base58-encoded seed

```
$account->getSeed();
// or as a property
$account->seed
```

Get base58-encoded public key (nonce = 0)

```
$account->getPublicKey();
// or as a property
$account->publicKey
```

Get base58-encoded private key (nonce = 0)

```
$account->getPrivateKey();
// or as a property
$account->privateKey
```

Get base58-encoded address

```
$account->getAddress();
// or as a property
$account->address
```

Use the following solution instead of '/utils/hash' API method
```
// returns H6nsiifwYKYEx6YzYD7woP1XCn72RVvx6tC1zjjLXqsu
\Wavesapi\Account::chainedHash('ridethewaves!')
```

### Address
All path-related classes are subclasses of \Wavesapi\Request. You have to configure the superclass by passing hostname and api_key in the constructor of the child object.
Port number should be specified in host param if necessary.
```
$address = new \Wavesapi\Address([
  'host'    => $host,
  'api_key' => $api_key
]);
// list of addresses in the node's wallet
$address->getList();
// create new address for the current seed
$address->create();
// balance in WAVES for account {address} after {confirmations} confirmations
$address->getBalance($address, $confirmations);
```
### Transaction
```
$txn = new \Wavesapi\Transaction();
// transaction's data by its id 
$txn->getById($txn_id);
// latest transactions by a given address
$txn->getByAccount($addr, $limit);
```
### Assets
```
$assets = new \Wavesapi\Assets();

// balances for all assets that the account with given address ever had (besides WAVES)
$assets->getBalance($addr);

// account's balance for a given asset
$assets->getBalanceForId($addr, $assetId)

// distribution of asset balance over accounts
$assets->getDistribution($assetId);
```

Publish signed asset transfer transaction to the blockchain:
```
// every key in the pair is also expected to be base58-encoded string
// timestamp should be passed in milliseconds, e.g. time() * 1000
$assets->setCredentials($senderPublicKey, $senderPrivateKey);
$assets->broadcastTransfer([
  'assetId'       =>  $assetId,
  'recipient'     =>  $recipient,
  'amount'        =>  $amount,
  'fee'           =>  $fee,
  'feeAssetId'    =>  $feeAssetId,
  'timestamp'     =>  $timestamp,
  'attachment'    =>  $attachment
]);
```

### Matcher

DEX access object is designed to be configured separately because hostname and/or port for matcher are usually not the same as for the rest-api module.

```
$dex = new \Wavesapi\Matcher([
  'host' => $host
]);

// matcher's public key
$dex->getPublicKey();
```

Price and amount are always specified as integers with merged decimal positions.
Price (price per unit) **should be normalized** on WAVES asset precision accordingly to the formula $normPrice = $price * (10^8 / $amountAssetPrecision).

```
// price-amount orderbook (depth of market) for a given asset pair
$dex->getDOM($amountAsset, $priceAsset);

$dex->setCredentials($senderPublicKey, $senderPrivateKey);

// order history for a given public key
$dex->getHistoryByPublicKey();

// create limit order
// minimum fee is 0.001 WAV ($matcherFee = 100000)
$dex->createOrder([
  'matcherPublicKey'  =>  $matcherPublicKey,
  'amountAsset'       =>  $amountAsset,
  'priceAsset'        =>  $priceAsset,
  'orderType'         =>  'buy', // or 'sell'
  'price'             =>  $price,
  'amount'            =>  $amount,
  'timestamp'         =>  $timestamp,
  'expiration'        =>  $expiration,
  'matcherFee'        =>  $matcherFee 
]);

// cancel previously created order
$dex->cancelOrder([
  'amountAsset'  =>  $amountAsset,
  'priceAsset'   =>  $priceAsset,
  'orderId'      =>  $orderId
]);
```
### Request export
If special `EXPORT` flag is provided API request will be not sent and corresponding method will return an associative array with the following keys: `type`, `headers`, `host`, `uri` and `data`. Then custom socket program (not CURL) can be used to perform the request, or it can be transmitted to a client such as web browser and applied via XHR / AJAX.
```
$address = new \Wavesapi\Address([
  'host'    => $host,
  'api_key' => $api_key,
  'flags'   => \Wavesapi\Request::EXPORT
]);
